## Purpose of this Repository

Parth (@bparth24) created this repository while reading the tech specs with the intention of simplifying and enhancing the readability of the content. The goal is to make complex concepts easier to understand by providing additional explanations, visuals, and improved sectioning. By re-writing sections of the [Enterprise Ethereum Alliance Distributed Ledger Technology Interoperability Technical Specification Draft Version 1.0](https://entethalliance.github.io/crosschain-interoperability/draft_dlt-interop_techspec.html), this repository aims to facilitate a better understanding of the material for all members involved.
